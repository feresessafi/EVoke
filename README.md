## Evoke - The AI-Powered News Platform

Evoke is an AI-driven platform designed to refresh and deliver news dynamically, revolutionizing content creation in the Electric Vehicle (EV), Sustainability, and Automotive sectors. This project was developed as part of the **Hackatum 2024 - Hubert Burda Media Challenge**.

## Inspiration

Growing up, I witnessed my mother’s dedication as a journalist and the challenges she faced with time-consuming content creation. Her experience inspired us to develop **Evoke** to streamline the process and empower creators worldwide.

## What It Does

- **Automated News and Content Generation** for EV, Sustainability, and select Automotive topics.
- **Real-Time News Feed Analysis and Classification** for better content recommendations.
- Generates **Articles**, **Videos**, **Podcasts**, and more on desired topics.
- Provides an **Admin Dashboard** to manage content generation, publication, and view analytics.

## What's Next for Evoke

We’re expanding **Evoke** to support multiple languages and integrating advanced personalization features, enabling creators to connect with global audiences more effectively than ever before.
